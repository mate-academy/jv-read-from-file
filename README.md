# jv-read-from-file
You are given a file. You need to filter out only the words starting with `w`.

The result should be returned as a naturally sorted array.
  
All words should be lower-case. If the file does not contain the necessary words, return an empty array.

Example: Width world Wide web

Result: \["web", "wide", "width", "world"]
